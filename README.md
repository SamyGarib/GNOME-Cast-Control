# Google Cast Control for GNOME Shell

A simple GNOME extention client for [vervallsweg's Cast Web API Node application](https://github.com/vervallsweg/cast-web-api-cli) allowing you to control the playback of your Google Cast devices on your local network.

Please note that the extention is currently still in an **ALPHA** stage. I started this project as a personal pet project, with little experince of GNOME's GJS language, so the project requires substantial polish before being published to extentions.gnome.org
